## CHANGELOG
* 2.0 - added :stop(name) function. Also, when a timer expires or is stopped it will stop the stop watch. Added argument for whether to display the time on the timer or not.
* 2.1 - Added option to provide a caption for the timer, such that the text appears after the time (if showTime is true) or just as the text on the gauge (if showTime is false)
* 2.2 - Added :pause(name), :start(name) functions to allow pausing and restarting of timers. The difference between pause and stop is that pause will leave the timer visible on the screen, and stop will hide it.
* 3.0 - Added :pauseAll(), :stopAll(), :destroy(name), and :destroyAll() functions
      Constructor has changed as well, in order to make facilitating future options easier
* 3.1 - added hook option to options table. Set to either an already defined function or a string of lua code to execute. When the timer expires, the code or function will be executed. If not set, does nothing.

### demonnic.anitimer:new(name, constructor, time, tableOfOptions)
This will create a new animated timer, named name. constructor should be a standard constructor for a Geyser.Gauge. time is the amount of time in seconds for the timer to run for. tableOfOptions has the following available options right now
- showTime: true or false boolean value. Defaults to true. This determines whether the amount of time left in the timer is shown on the timer or not
- timerCaption: string value. If you want some other text to show up on the timer, this is where you set it
- cssFront: string value. This should be a qt stylesheet, as you might normally pass to a Mudlet Label
- cssBack: string value. This should be a qt stylesheet, as you might normally pass to a Mudlet Label
- hook: New in 3.1. string value or function. If you have a function you would execute as `myHook()`, set `hook = myHook`. If you instead wish to execute arbitrary lua code pass a string, such as `hook = [[echo("test successful")]]`

it should be noted that if you specify cssFront, then cssBack will be the same as cssFront, but it will have a "background-color: black;" constraint added to the stylesheet in order to try and ensure some contrast between the two. One example would be:
```
local myCss1 = [[
border-width: 4px;
border-radius: 7;
border-color: red;
background-color: green;
]]
local myCss2 = [[
border-width: 4px;
border-radius: 7;
border-color: green;
background-color: red;
]]
demonnic.anitimer:new("Test2", {x = 0, y="50%", height = 20, width = "100%"}, 10, {container = demonnic.newContainer, showTime = true, timerCaption = "Test2", cssFront = myCss1, cssBack = myCss2})
```

This is one of the timers in the included "anitimer demo" alias. I set 4 timers up in this alias, it should provide you with some insight into how it looks.


### demonnic.anitimer:stop("myTimer") 
stops "myTimer" and removes it from the screen

### demonnic.anitimer:start("myTimer") 
restarts "myTimer" if there is any time left on it, and if so shows it on the screen

### demonnic.anitimer:pause("myTimer") 
stops "myTimer" but leaves it visible on the screen

### demonnic.anitimer:destroy("myTimer")
stops "myTimer", removes it from the screen, and then nils out the timer, removing it from tracking. Use this is you want a timer to really go away and not be brought back by startAll()

### demonnic.anitimer:startAll()
will start every timer which is being tracked which is also not active (active timers are already started, after all)

### demonnic.anitimer:pauseAll() 
stops all timers, but leaves any timers which were visible on the screen

### demonnic.anitimer:stopAll()
stops all timers and removes them from the screen

### demonnic.anitimer:destroyAll()
destroys all animated timers
